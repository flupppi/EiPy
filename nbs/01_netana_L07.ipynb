    "So basically in the last lecture we talked about network partitioning which separated a network into $K$ equal size parts while minimizing the cut size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question that is now obvious is what happens if we don't want balanced partitions because it wouldn't represent the structure in our network well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning forces a structure upon our network that might or might not be there essentially. But we would rather want to find out what the internal grouping structure of a network, without making assumptions about it beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **community detection** comes in. A community is a group of nodes that is formed by mutual adjacency, proximity or reachability. It suggests the presence of real-world interaction for a common purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes in a community are more likely to connect to each other than to nodes form other communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal here will be to find algorithms that can detect the presence and the size and type of each of these communities in our network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Community? How is it defined?\n",
    "Something about the nodes knowing each other. And something about the internal-degree having to be larger than the external-degree. So basically a clique, so a network where everyone knows everyone is a community. It even is a strong community because exactly everyone knows everyone. There can also be a community in a less \"optimal\" network. So there is a concept of strong and weak communities, depending on the degree of everyone in the group knowing everyone else in the group.\n",
    "#### Community Detection\n",
    "Beyond the term Community there is also a mayor problem of detecting communities in networks. This is not easy and not every network does necessarily have a community. So algorithms have to be able to detect them if they are there but also be able to say that the arent. It seems like there are two mayor methods. They are handeled in two subsections, namely Modularity and Divisive, which seem to be just two different methods for doing this.\n",
