# networks


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This project is a documentation for the topics of the Lecture **Network
Analysis** at the University of Konstanz in the Summer Semester 2025. I
cover most of the topics that were talked about in the lecture and
provide explanations and examples in own words. My goal is also to
enrich the information shown in the lecture with information I found
myself in other sources while studying for this course.

In addition to the theoretical coverage I also provide my solutions for
the exercises given in the course. By writing this documentation using
jupyter notebooks and nbdev, I am able to combine both high quality
markdown rendered text with results from actual python code and the full
code itself that produces these results.

## Developer Guide

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

### Install networks in Development mode

``` sh
# make sure networks package is installed in development mode
$ pip install -e .
# but prefer

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to networks
$ nbdev_prepare
```

## Usage

### Installation

Install latest from the GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/flupppi/networks):

``` sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/flupppi/networks.git
```

or from [conda](https://anaconda.org/flupppi/networks)

``` sh
$ conda install -c flupppi networks
```

or from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/networks/)

``` sh
$ pip install networks
```
