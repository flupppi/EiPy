## Networks

What are networks, so all the fundamentals one might want to know about
networks.

## Networks in the News

Here we collect a number of sources where you find Networks be relevant
to in the wild. So real-world incidents where we as network analysts
could have something to say about what happened and what can be observed
there and why. He collects some of these for us but it might be fun to
be on the lookout when looking at the news ourselves.

## Applications of Networks

Some areas where networks are relevant. These are described in great
detail in the Newman Book, so for more info we can also look there he
just uses Criminalistics and Biological networks as some of his examples
when talking about networks. So knowing about these application areas is
predominantly important because it gives us the chance to actually
understand the examples better and relate to why some of the metrics are
important.

# Cheat Sheet

For the topics of each lecture I also want to create a cheat sheet with
the most important terminology and Formulas. Just to keep track of what
i definately need to know 100 percent for sure.

- *G* = (*V*, *E*)
- *A* = Adjacency Matrix
- *k* = node degree
